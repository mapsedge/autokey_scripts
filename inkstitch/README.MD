All of the scripts in this folder automate what would otherwise be mouse-moves and clicks.

break path at nodes: As it clicks a toolbar button, you will need to alter this script to your own screen resolution.

collapse all layers: in the layers/objects panel, place your mouse pointer over the first hide/lock/expand-collapse icon. The script will click, move down one, click again, move down one, click...for as many times as the script calls for. You will need to alter this script to your screen resolution and desired number of repeats.
